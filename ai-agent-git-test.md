## Alternative Testing Method

If you cannot push to the repository, please:

1. **Modify this file** with your test results
2. **Create a test file** with your name
3. **Report in your response** what you were able to do

This way, even if git push fails, we can still verify your file system access.

## Expected Outcomes

- **Full Access**: Can read, write, and push to repository
- **Partial Access**: Can read/write files but not push
- **Read Only**: Can only read files
- **No Access**: Cannot access files at all
