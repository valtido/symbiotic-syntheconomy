# Webhook Test

This file is created to test webhook functionality after fixing the GitHub webhook URL.

## Expected Results:

1. ✅ GitHub webhook should deliver successfully (green checkmark)
2. ✅ Backend should process the webhook event
3. ✅ Patch file should be generated in patches/ folder
4. ✅ Real-time monitoring should show activity

## Current Status:

- Webhook URL: https://symbiotic-syntheconomy.loca.lt/webhook/github
- Backend: Running and healthy
- LocalTunnel: Active and forwarding requests

If this commit triggers a patch file, the webhook is working correctly!
