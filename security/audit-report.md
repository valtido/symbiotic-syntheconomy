# Security Audit Report

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security audit conducted on the Symbiotic Syntheconomy project, covering API endpoints, smart contracts, AI filters, data storage, and authentication mechanisms. Additionally, it describes the implementation of automated vulnerability scanning and security testing within the CI/CD pipeline.

## Audit Scope
- **API Endpoints**: Evaluated for input validation, rate limiting, and proper authentication/authorization.
- **Smart Contracts**: Audited for common vulnerabilities such as reentrancy, overflow/underflow, and gas optimization issues.
- **AI Filters**: Reviewed for potential biases, data leakage, and model integrity.
- **Data Storage**: Assessed for encryption, access control, and data integrity.
- **Authentication**: Checked for secure token management, password hashing, and session handling.

## Findings
### API Endpoints
- **Issue**: Lack of rate limiting on critical endpoints.
- **Recommendation**: Implement rate limiting using libraries like `express-rate-limit`.
- **Status**: Resolved.

### Smart Contracts
- **Issue**: Potential reentrancy vulnerability in token transfer functions.
- **Recommendation**: Use OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard` or equivalent.
- **Status**: In Progress.

### AI Filters
- **Issue**: Insufficient logging of model decisions.
- **Recommendation**: Add detailed logging for transparency and debugging.
- **Status**: Resolved.

### Data Storage
- **Issue**: Unencrypted sensitive data in transit.
- **Recommendation**: Enforce HTTPS and use secure storage solutions.
- **Status**: Resolved.

### Authentication
- **Issue**: Weak password policy.
- **Recommendation**: Enforce stronger password requirements and use bcrypt for hashing.
- **Status**: Resolved.

## Automated Vulnerability Scanning
Automated scanning tools have been integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure continuous security monitoring.

### Tools Used
- **Trivy**: For container image and dependency scanning.
- **OWASP ZAP**: For dynamic application security testing (DAST).
- **SonarQube**: For static code analysis.
- **Slither**: For smart contract auditing.

### CI/CD Integration
The following GitHub Actions workflow has been added to `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`:

```yaml
name: Security Scan
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  security_scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run Trivy vulnerability scanner
        uses: aquasecurity/trivy-action@master
        with:
          scan-type: 'fs'
          scan-ref: '.'
          format: 'table'
          output: 'trivy-results.txt'
      - name: Upload Trivy scan results
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: trivy-results
          path: trivy-results.txt
```

## Conclusion
The security audit identified several issues, most of which have been resolved or are in progress. Automated vulnerability scanning ensures ongoing protection against emerging threats. Regular audits and updates to security practices are recommended.

## Next Steps
- Complete resolution of smart contract vulnerabilities.
- Schedule quarterly security audits.
- Enhance monitoring and alerting for security incidents.
